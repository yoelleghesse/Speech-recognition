This script uses the SpeechRecognition library to perform speech recognition on an audio file. It loads an audio file, transcribes the speech using Google's speech recognition service, and prints the transcribed text.

Install SpeechRecognition:

``pip install SpeechRecognition``

Place the audio file (chile.wav in this example) in the same directory as the script.

Execute the Python script to perform speech recognition:

``python speech_recognition.py``
